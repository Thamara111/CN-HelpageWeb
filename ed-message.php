            Sri Lankan Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            Recent statistics show that the ageing population in
            Sri Lanka especially those exceeding 60 years of age is
            currently 17.2% of the total population. The percentage
            of older people worldwide is increasing and it is likely
            to go up to 25% by around 2041 which is a growing
            concern. This is primarily due to increasing life
            expectancy along with a shift in demographic patterns,
            improvements in living standards, advances in medical
            care and a decline in fertility rates. For a developing
            country such as Sri Lanka, the challenges are immense
            and tackling the associated issues will be formidable.
          </p>

      <p>
        The Ageing Index which refers to the population over
        60 years as against children under 15 years shows a
        tremendous increase. Sri Lanka’s 1981 census statistics
        show that for every 100 children under the age of 15
        years there were 21 persons over the age of 60 years.
        The figure of 21 increased to 42 in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        The World Bank and other international aid
        organisations have emphasised the need for countries
        to have policies supporting the elderly such as
        retirement income support and continuous health care.
        In Sri Lanka, there is an uneven distribution of the older
        population with 31% residing in the Western Province,
        13.1% in the Southern Province and 3.8% in the Central
        Province while in other provinces the figure is around
        5% each. One of the key factors for this has been
        internal migration across districts. This is a significant
        challenge which the Government of Sri Lanka should
        address when formulating national policies on social
        support systems for ensuring a healthy future for the
        elderly population.

        Appreciation
      </h4>

      <p> I was appointed General Manager (Executive Director
        designate) on 1 January 2025 and assumed duties as the
        Executive Director on 1 February 2025 succeeding
        Mr. Samantha Liyanawaduge who retired from active
        service at the HASL. I extend my best wishes to
        Mr. Liyanawaduge for a happy retirement.</p>
      <p> I extend my heartfelt gratitude to HASL Chairman,
        Deshabandu Tilak de Zoysa and all other members of
        the Council of Management for the confidence placed in
        me and for the valuable guidance given.</p>
      <p> I wish to thank HelpAge International (HAI) Regional
        Director, Mr. Eduardo Klien for all the support extended
        to HASL at all times.</p>
      <p> My sincere thanks to all our invaluable donors local and
        foreign and all the donor agencies for the confidence
        placed in HASL. If not for their generosity, HASL could
        not have served the destitute elders successfully for the
        past so many decades.</p>
      <p> I also thank HASL’s bankers, company secretaries,
        internal auditors, external auditors, printers and all
        other stakeholders for the support extended and
        valuable services provided.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, HASL’s achievements are due to
        the unstinted support and dedication of the Heads
        of Divisions, Managers, Executives and all other staff
        members at HASL and my thanks are due to them. As we
        are completing four decades of great service to needy
        elders in Sri Lanka by the end of the next financial year,
        the commitment of all HASL staff is expected in the
        same vein to overcome whatever challenges HASL may
        face in serving the elders more effectively.</p>
