                Chairman’s Message
            </h2>

            <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

                <p>2021/2022 was no easy year for HelpAge Sri Lanka. The Corona Virus had, and still continues to have
                    an impact on every aspect of our daily lives and our social lives, leaving traces of adverse
                    consequences.</p>

                <p>Despite the COVID shocks, I’m heartened to note that HASL has performed remarkably well and better in
                    the year under review. The performance of service delivery and economic wellbeing has outnumbered
                    the achievements of 2019/2020, the pre-COVID period.</p>

                <p>The global impact of COVID-19 has had rippling effects in our part of the world. Needless to say that
                    the lives of poor elders have become even more challenging. This publication provides a glimpse of
                    elder abuse based on the Policy Brief: <em>The Impact of COVID-19 on older persons</em>, published
                    in May 2020 by the United Nations.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10">Violence, Neglect and Abuse</h3>

                <p>Abuse of older persons has been on the rise and estimates before the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that
                    1 in 6 older persons were subjected to abuse in 2017 and 2018. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there
                    have been widespread reports of increased rates of violence against women, and particularly intimate
                    partner violence, exacerbated by lockdown conditions. While age-disaggregated data is not available,
                    policy responses need to incorporate the needs and rights of older persons, especially older women,
                    whose dependence on family members for their daily survival and care, make them especially
                    vulnerable to abuse.</p>

                <p>The pandemic leaves many older victims without access to assistance and services. Special attention
                    needs to be given in contingency plans and strategies to address the amplified threats faced by
                    older refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs) and provide access to health
                    treatment and care, including access to national health services where capacity for acute care will
                    be higher.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10">Island-Wide Programmes</h3>

                <p>In its ‘Way forward’, the policy brief suggests: “Older persons have long been subject to inadequate
                    protection of their human rights and overlooked in national policies and programmes. COVID-19
                    recovery is an opportunity to set the stage for a more inclusive, equitable and age-friendly
                    society, anchored in human rights and guided by the shared promise of the 2030 Agenda for
                    Sustainable Development to <em>Leave No One Behind</em>.”</p>

                <p>Whilst being knowledgeable about the seriousness of the circumstances the elder population faces
                    today, the activities of HelpAge Sri Lanka will be of much relief to the most affected.</p>

                <p>HelpAge Sri Lanka endeavours towards the poor marginalised elders and the benefits they enjoy due to
                    HASL programmes and Projects are evident in the pages to follow. Leaving behind a difficult time and
                    heading towards a more grey tomorrow in view of the present economic and political crisis of our
                    beautiful country, we still need the help and cooperation of our generous donors, well-wishers and
                    all stakeholders to continue our meritorious deeds to uplift the lives of the elderly. It is our
                    responsibility to ensure that their rights and dignity is safeguarded at all times.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10">Acknowledgement</h3>

                <p>First and foremost, I would like to thank all our loyal donors who have been with us for so long
                    through good and bad times. We also want to pay our respects to the donors we have lost and to their
                    families, all of whom are very much in our thoughts.</p>

                <p>We owe a special word of ‘Thank You’ to Age International, HelpAge International (HAI) and its Global
                    Emergency Fund (GEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UN Habitat, UNDP, Berendina
                    Development Services (Gte) Ltd and all other international and national donors including the
                    Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT), for their continued support that pulled us through this
                    most difficult period.</p>

                <p>I wish to convey my gratitude to Mr. Kamantha Amarasekera and Dr. P.N. Fernando for their magnanimous
                    donations to strengthen the HelpAge Programmes and services.</p>

                <p>A special word of acknowledgement is extended to the Deputy Chairman Deshabandu Ajit Jayaratne for
                    his advice and guidance in the area of finances of HASL.</p>

                <p>My colleague and Honorary Member of the Council, Mr. Nimal Dias Jayasinha’s guidance and direction,
                    particularly in the Home Care Assistance Programme is acknowledged with gratitude.</p>

                <p>I am particularly grateful to our Honorary Member of the Council, Mr. Nishantha Gooneratne for his
                    deep commitment and interest in the operational aspects of HASL and for the assistance provided to
                    the Executive Director.</p>

                <p>The guidance and advice extended by the Honorary Member of the Council, Dr. (Mrs.) Champa Banagala in
                    relation to the functioning of the Eye Hospital is very much appreciated.</p>

                <p>I am pleased to acknowledge the valuable contribution of Ms. Yasmin Raheem and Ms. Anosha Subasinghe,
                    honorary members of the Council for their assistance in compiling the HASL annual reports for the
                    past several years.</p>

                <p>The support and assistance of all other Honorary Members of the Council are also acknowledged with
                    much gratitude.</p>

                <p>It is my duty to thank Mr. Samantha Liyanawaduge, the Executive Director of HASL who is the leader in
                    the forefront, the person who withstands all shocks and difficulties of the battle. This is a
                    special note to acknowledge his resilience during the turbulent period of time.</p>

                <p>I also thank profoundly all Heads and members of the management teams for their dedication and
                    support. Their immense commitment and hard work has paid the dividends.</p>

                <p>My sincere acknowledgement goes out to Dr. Vijith Kannangara, the Chairman of Smart Media, The Annual
                    Report Company and his team for their complimentary services in producing this Annual Report and
                    assisting HASL likewise for the past 14 years.</p>

                <p>I would also wish to thank the Partners of D. N. Thurairajah and Company, and Ceylon Secretarial
                    Services (Pvt) Limited for continuing to provide complimentary secretarial services to HASL and also
                    to our Auditors, Wijeyeratne &amp; Company, Chartered Accountants for serving us for years.</p>

                <p>These are unprecedented times of challenges and hardships and the elderly population requires special
                    care. The elders who are mostly engaged in their own small businesses and depend on their limited
                    income for daily living will be in dire straits. I earnestly hope that, with the support of all our
                    stakeholders including our loyal donors and other well-wishers, HASL will continue to stand braving
                    many storms to serve our elders.</p>
