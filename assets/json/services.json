                    "description": "The Free Cataract Surgery Project was sponsored by the Jeco Foundation (coordinated through Amico Corporation). Reported in FY 2024/25, the project is described as providing around 500 free cataract surgeries per month — roughly 250 at the HelpAge Eye Hospital and 250 at partner government hospitals. The sponsorship supports surgical costs and lenses for low-income elders, contributing to the Eye Hospital’s ongoing mission to eliminate cataract-related blindness among disadvantaged senior citizens. The project and related donor visits and coordination are discussed in the Eye Hospital section of the Annual Report.",
