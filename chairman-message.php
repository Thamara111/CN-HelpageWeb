            In <strong>1986</strong>, our invaluable and unforgettable <strong>Founder
              Chairman, the late Mr. H. P. Gooneratne</strong> and his
            Committee members, established <strong>HelpAge Sri Lanka</strong>
            and began its modest journey. This was inspired by
            <strong>Mr. John F. Pearson of HelpAge International (HAI)</strong> to
            further develop the facilities provided in Sri Lanka
            for its elders, not only to be cared for, but also to be
            empowered to lead lives with <strong>dignity and respect</strong>.
            Over the past four decades, <strong>HASL</strong> has grown to be the
            leading <strong>“Non-Government Organization”</strong> dedicated,
            to improving the quality of life of <strong>senior citizens</strong>,
            irrespective of race, religion, social or economic
            background.

      <p class=" text-justify">
        Throughout the past 40 years, <strong>HASL</strong> has made
        significant strides. Its flagship, the <strong>HelpAge Eye
          Hospital, Colombo 6</strong>, has performed <strong>52,249 cataract
          surgeries</strong> on a free of charge basis and our
        <strong>Mobile Medical Units</strong> have provided thousands of
        medical consultations to the needy elders, who would
        have otherwise, been neglected without the required
        medical care. <strong>HASL’s livelihood support, elders’ rights
          advocacy, and health awareness campaigns</strong> have
        touched the lives of countless individuals, giving them
        <strong>hope and dignity</strong>, where and when it is most needed.
      </p>
      <p class=" text-justify">
        In recent years, we have also taken bold steps, to
        address the emerging challenges of an ageing society.
        With Sri Lanka’s elderly population expected to reach
        <strong>25% by 2040</strong>, <strong>HASL’s responsibility</strong>
        is more challenging than before. The demographic shift presents,
        both a setback as well as an opportunity, which requires
        <strong>more inclusive policies, intergenerational solidarity</strong> and
        a collective reimaging of how Sri Lankans and <strong>HASL</strong>,
        value and care for its <strong>Senior Citizens</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        <strong>HASL</strong> is also indebted to all its <strong>Corporate and Individual
          donors</strong> in Sri Lanka and Overseas. I deeply value and
        appreciate the unstinted co-operation, received from
        the <strong>Members of the Council</strong>. The efforts of each and
        every Council member, working together as a team, has
        so far enabled us to achieve, all our objectives and goals.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        I would at this stage, take a moment to convey our
        thanks to <strong>Mr. Samantha Liyanawaduge</strong> who retired,
        after, a productive and effective term, as the <strong>Executive Director
          of HelpAge Sri Lanka</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        Having said that, I am overwhelmed and very happy
        to welcome, <strong>Dr. Harsha Bandara</strong>, who has already,
        proactively begun his important role, as the newly
        appointed <strong>Executive Director of HelpAge Sri Lanka</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        It is with much regret, that I place on record the
        resignation of our Council member <strong>Mr. Nimal Dias
          Jayasinha</strong>. During his tenure of <strong>18 years</strong>, he made an extremely positive
        contribution,
        enhancing the growth of <strong>HASL</strong>. In addition to this, he made an unexpected
        donation of a <strong>three-story building valued at over Rs. 50 Million</strong>.
        This building is currently being used as a <strong>Training Centre
          for the Home Care Division</strong>, which he himself, introduced,
        a few years back. <strong>HelpAge Sri Lanka</strong>, will always be indebted to
        <strong>Mr. Nimal Dias Jayasinha</strong> for his exemplary loyalty and enhancing
        the stature of <strong>HASL</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        I wish to thank <strong>Dr. Vijith Kannangara</strong> the Chairman of
        Smart Media, for providing complimentary services,
        for designing and printing of our <strong>Annual Report</strong>. I also
        wish to convey my appreciation, to <strong>Ceylon Secretarial
          Services (Pvt) Limited</strong> and to our Auditors, <strong>Wijeyeratne & Company</strong>,
        for their most trusted services, since the establishment of
        <strong>HelpAge Sri Lanka</strong> in 1986.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        Whilst being very grateful to <strong>Dr. (Mrs.) Champa
          Banagala</strong>, for overlooking our <strong>Eye Hospital</strong>, I am equally
        indebted to <strong>Ms. Yasmin Raheem</strong> and <strong>Ms. Anosha
          Subasinghe</strong>, for editing and compiling our <strong>Annual Report</strong>,
        continuously, on a year on year, basis.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        I would also, like to extend our sincere most thanks to
        <strong>Mr. Sanjeev Gardiner</strong> for his guidance and for hosting all
        our <strong>Council meetings</strong> at the <strong>Galle Face Hotel</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        Finally, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to <strong>Mr. Maithri
          Wickremesinghe P.C.</strong>, <strong>Mr. Nishantha Gooneratne</strong> and
        <strong>Mr. Krishan Balendra</strong>, for their deep commitment
        and more importantly for sharing their invaluable
        knowledge, in the fields of, <strong>management, finance and legal matters</strong>.
      </p class=" text-justify">

      <p class=" text-justify">
        As we commemorate the <strong>40th anniversary</strong>, we convey
        our gratitude to <strong>HelpAge International (HAI)</strong> and <strong>Age
          UK</strong>, for having made our celebration a reality. Together,
        we have built more than just an Institution, but a legacy
        of care, advocacy, and hope for a future, where ageing is
        not feared but embraced with <strong>dignity and security</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        In a recent press release by <strong>Mr. Cherian Mathews
          the CEO of HelpAge International (HAI) U.K.</strong>, who
        was on a visit to Sri Lanka, in 2025, had stated that,
        <strong>HelpAge Sri Lanka</strong>, is calling for the <strong>Protection of the Rights of Elders Act No. 09
          of 2000</strong>,
        to be updated and strengthened, alongside the development of national
        strategies on <strong>Healthy Ageing, Social Pensions, and Social Protection</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class=" text-justify">
        Let us continue to move forward with renewed purpose,
        honouring our past and building a better tomorrow for
        the <strong>Elders of Sri Lanka</strong>.
